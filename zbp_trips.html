         <h1>The Peninsula Trail (aka The Trial Run, The Prequel, w/e) <cite>(20220328)</cite></h1>
         <p>This was a day-hike trial run we did at the end of March 2022. The idea was to suit
            up with most (we thought) of our gear and day-hike a short 3+ mile route. It went great,
            we had a nice lunch on a tiny bridge and both felt ready for the next step. The Peninsula Trail, 
            Selinde Roosenberg Trail trailheads and the Iron Furnance parking lots are all in the 
            same general area.
         </p>
         <br />
         <h1>First Trip, (Too) Early Spring 2022 <cite>(20220417_18)</cite></h1>
         <p>Ah, you never forget <cite>your first time</cite>. Almost a complete disaster,
            it really is a wonder we ever went back. Indeed it took 6 months before we
            attempted it again. Still feeling more like a full dress rehearsal, we had decided
            to do a simple overnight. We planned to hike in 5 miles, camp overnight at Campsite #3
            and then hike out the next afternoon. No problem, right? What could go wrong?
         </p>
         <p>Well, plenty. The inclines were WAY more than we planned for. The trail, in places, was
            blocked by fallen trees and extremely narrow. Our packs were grossly overloaded and 
            heavy with equipment we didn't use. It took us over 8 hours to go 5 miles! The complete
            list of rookie mistakes is too long for this page! When we finally made camp we were
            tired, cold and more than a little grouchy. On the second day we actually left the trail
            and followed the paved road back to the parking lot. And vowed to never do it again!
         </p>
         <br />
         <h1>Fall 2022 <cite>(20221016_17)</cite></h1>
         <p>Redemption! The second time we tried backpack hiking in Zaleski we made sure
            we scaled back our expectation of ourselves. We kept it to a single overnight. 
            Also a bit wiser, we looked closer at the trail map and took closer note of 
            elevation changes and distances. Based on that we decided to do the South Loop 
            from the Furnace Parking Lot to Campsite #1. This was a distance of only 2 miles 
            with most of the hard stuff in the first mile.
         </p>
         <p>We had a much better experience this time! We actually enjoyed ourselves, had some 
            better food and packed much lighter. We even had time to notice there were no critters 
            trying to steal our food at night. This was the last trip with just the two of us 
            because the following week we got our puppy Roger.
         </p>

         <h1>Spring 2023 #1 <cite>(20230416_18)</cite></h1>
         <p>Technically, we cheated. We stayed in a nearby hotel because it was too cold!
            But we did day-hike alot! We visited Moonville Tunnel and hiked on the Rails to Trails
            path. Afterwards we went to the Hope Schoolhouse trailhead and tried a quick
            hike. We managed to get turned around (not lost, there's a difference) and didn't realize
            where we were until we saw Point B. Luckily we recognized it from the last trip.
         </p>
         <br />
         <h1>Spring 2023 #2 <cite>(20230521_23)</cite></h1>
         <p>THE BIG TEST! A little more than a month from the last trip, we implemented a number of changes:
         <ol>
            <li>Increased duration to 3 days and 2 nights</li>
            <li>Increased distance by ~1mile by leaving from<br />Hope Schoolhouse trailhead vs. Iron Furnace</li>
            <li>Set goal to complete entire South Loop</li>
            <li>Brought along our new puppy Roger</li>
         </ol></p>
         <p>We camped the first night at Campsite #1 and the second night at Campsite #2. It was tough, not
            going to lie. Total distance of ~10miles. Day1 was 4 miles, Day2 was also 4 miles and Day3 was a 
            mere 2 miles. We made an effort to take our time and it took it slow. At the end of each day our
            feet hurt and shoulders ached but nothing was near as bad as the first time.
         </p>
         <br />
         <h1>Latest Trip, Mid-Summer 2023 <cite>(20230625-27)</cite></h1>
         <p>Feeling pretty confident we decided to recreate the magic on this trip but in reverse!
            We did the same path as last time but camped at Campsite #2 on the first night and
            Campsite #1 on the second night.
         </p>
         <p>A cool thing happened on this trip. While we were talking around our campfire
            a large tree fell off in the near distance. The cool part was it just happened
            spontaneously. There were no winds blowing or anyone knocking it over. 
            It just happened and we were there to see it! </p>
         <p>One thing we got away from on this trip, was packing light. Rookie mistake! We
            brought too many creature comforts and the journey was arduous because if it.
